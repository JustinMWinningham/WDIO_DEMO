 WebdriverIO Demo Repo - Ready to Run

## Getting started
- clone repo to desired location
- enter repo directory
- Enter the following commands

Congrats! you are ready to go. That was easy. Here is a test command you can try to make sure everything was installed correctly.

> npm run chrome_main -- --suite web

Crawl through the output and make sure there are no errors (warnings are ok) - if you don't find any, all is well :)
